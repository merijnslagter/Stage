        "description": "Commonland was founded in 2013 with the ambition to kick-start a landscape restoration \neconomy based on the 4 returns framework. With the support of the COmON Foundation, \nCommonland was able to develop landscape restoration projects in four countries, to \nstart educating the next generation of business leaders and to build a core team. Within \nthis short period Commonland has earned an international reputation as an innovative \nchange maker. In the coming five years Commonland will enter a new phase as a mature \norganization that demonstrates that the 4 returns framework can be implemented at scale, \nby inspiring and working together with others. Commonland aims to further realize its \nproject activities on the ground, increase its client-based partnerships, continue business \neducation, and work on outreach and acquisition of funding for all our activities. The \nCommonland Foundation is the engine to make this all happen. We aim to further build \nand strengthen the organisation, creating resilient teams, structures and processes to \noptimize all of our partnerships."

        "description": "A unique transformation is taking place in the Altiplano in southern Spain: hundreds of farmers and entrepreneurs are organizing themselves to realize the restoration of 630,000 hectares of degraded lands.\n\nTogether with association AlVelAl, Commonland developed a large-scale 4 returns landscape restoration plan for the region, which will be implemented in the coming years. One of the aspects of the restoration plan is the almendrehesa concept: an integrated production system which combines almond and local trees with aromatic oil crops, beekeeping, and sustainable grazing of the endemic lamb species. This productive ecosystem decreases erosion, restores water balance, enhances biodiversity, and beautifies the landscape. Altogether, this enhances the local economy while promoting local pride and inspiration. \n\nNext to that, over 30 business cases with the potential to contribute to landscape restoration have been identified and we are establishing several demo farms and a research center to support capacity building and demonstrate the economic potential of the almendrehesa concept.

        "description": "Large opportunities lie in restoring the Port Elizabeth catchment area. The area in South Africa covers 500,000 hectares and consists of the Baviaans, Kouga, and Krom catchments. These catchments supply 70% of the water to the one million inhabitants living in the city of Port Elizabeth, and the areas surrounding the Kouga and Krom are crucial for food production for South Africa.\n\nHowever, the catchments are suffering from the effects of decades of overgrazing and unsustainable land management, leading to decreased water absorption by the land. Along with the changing climate and invasive plants and trees, this overgrazing and unsustainable land management has accelerated the impact of droughts and floods, both in the catchments and downstream in Port Elizabeth. This has led to loss of carbon capture, biodiversity, and soil fertility – all of which reduce agricultural potential. It puts farmers, the existing industry of Port Elizabeth, and the employment of local people at risk.\n\nCommonland’s local implementing partners Grounded and Living Lands have been working together with the farmers, local business and government partners and identified a number of opportunities to contribute to the restoration of the Baviaans, Kouga and Krom catchments, with a business case. A business was established with the farmers to transition from traditional goat farming to more sustainable and profitable farming practices, a partnership was created to identify business opportunities for improved water security through ecosystem restoration on a large scale, and a large corporate partner has committed to support the active restoration of degraded hillsides through planting trees. This builds on the areas that have already been restored in collaboration with the South African government over the past years. "

        "description": "Large opportunities lie in the restoration of the Western Australian Wheatbelt. Our goal is to transform this degraded and depopulated landscape by developing inspirational solutions that will create new jobs and business opportunities; secure local food supplies; and restore biodiversity, soil and water quality. Doing so, we believe we can convert the Wheatbelt into a world-class sustainable Foodbelt.\n\nFailure to attract investment to the Wheatbelt up to now has resulted in a stagnation of the innovation of farming and land care practices. The area is over-cleared, depopulating, and the remaining family farmers are under significant financial pressure. They are often trapped in a cycle of debt that forces them to apply conventional, chemically-dependent farming practices.\n\nCommonland’s business partner Wide Open Agriculture is a future-focused company that has identified innovative solutions to regenerate the Wheatbelt landscape and its economy. These solutions include: innovative ecologically based farming practices enabled by sustainable water management systems; measures to restore the soils and biodiversity; bringing migrants – the ‘new Australians’ – to the area as employees or business partners; and an approach to scale-up, through listing on the Australian Stock Exchange, which would make it possible to attract equity from retail and institutional investors.

        "description": "Peat meadowlands are typical Dutch landscapes. They are home to the scenery of windmills, cows in the meadows, (migrating) bird populations and a showcase of our water management reputation.\n\nHowever, during the last three decades, these lands have experienced degradation through intensification and scaling of farming and systemic drainage & dewatering. This has greatly deteriorated the natural capital in the peat-meadow lands, causing systemic subsidence (with rising sea-levels) and has a high emission/climate impact. Furthermore, the average farmer family can barely make a living. A transition is greatly and clearly needed.\n\nRaising water tables is needed to conserve and restore the natural capital and prevent further soil subsidence and degradation. But this will have adverse impact on the current farming model. Additional and alternative revenue models must therefore be developed, ranging from sustainable livestock management to direct trade, from nutrient recycling to paludiculture and more.\n\nThe landscape area is situated in the west of the country, surrounding urban conglomerates like Amsterdam, Zaanstad, Hilversum and Utrecht. Here, we are working with local partners to develop and realize alternative forms of land use that, apart from generating income to landowners and farmers, also contribute to improved biodiversity & water quality and systemically reduce further subsidence. By doing so, we believe we can transform these ‘green deserts’ into a source of pride, value and nature for farmers, citizens and businesses. The Dutch are famous for transforming their landscapes and in this area it’s time for the next phase."
